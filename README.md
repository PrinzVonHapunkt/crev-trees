CREV-Trees: A collection of [Cardrunners EV](http://www.cardrunnersev.com) binary tree files for users to share, modify, and adapt for their own purposes.

The best way to learn poker is by example. Cardrunners EV is getting a lot of attention at [DeucesCracked](http://www.deucescracked.com) - especially in our Poker Theory Forum - and as poker becomes more and more complex, we're only going to be using tools like this more and more.

Hosting this on Github will allow us to track changes to trees over time, and allow people to learn how small changes in ranges, etc., can change the expected value of hands.

Naming Conventions
----------------------------

Folders should be created for each new hand, so we can easily collect different variants of the tree created by different users. Filenames should include your username and be easily identifiable for users at home - for example:

LHE-A9o-Should-I-Raise-Turn.stx

In the appropriate folder for that hand (in this case, LHE), modify the README to add that file/filename along with any relevant metadata to describe the hand and situation, and to link to a thread/video when appropriate.
